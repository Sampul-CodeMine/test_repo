# Test Repository

This is a simple repository that I am using to learn git branching and merging.

It will be deleted when I am done

```
# creating a branch

git branch branchname
git checkout branchname

or 

git checkout -b branchname

# to merge your master, main and other branches

git checkout master

git merge branchname -m "Your comment"
```
